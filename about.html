  <h1>About the Goldbach Orbit Method</h1>

  <p>This project presents the <strong>Goldbach Orbit Method</strong>, a predictive algorithm to find prime pairs <em>(p, q)</em> such that <em>p + q = E</em>, where <em>E</em> is a very large even number. The method is inspired by the structure of orbital shells and guided by the square root of E, exploring central, orbital, and peripheral zones to identify solutions.</p>

  <h2>Author</h2>
  <p><strong>Bouchaib Bouchaib</strong> is an independent researcher in mathematics based in Nantes, France. He has developed several innovative methods around number theory, biprime factorization, and Goldbach decompositions. This site is part of his public research efforts.</p>

  <h2>About the Site</h2>
  <p>The website allows anyone to enter a very large even number and instantly test the Goldbach Orbit Method online. It uses modern JavaScript with BigInt and root-based estimations to extend predictions beyond <strong>10¹⁹</strong>.</p>

  <p>This method is entirely public, experimental, and mathematically inspired. You can access the main calculator here:
